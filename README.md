# federated-medical-diagnosis
This project simulates a federated learning environment where two medical datasets — breast cancer and cardiovascular — are used to mimic client-side training. Each dataset is treated as a separate institution, and logistic regression or deep learning models are trained independently. Instead of using a real FL server, this setup manually aggregates performance metrics to emulate global model behavior.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Simulate federated learning behavior for healthcare diagnosis.
- Preserve data privacy by avoiding centralized data merging.
- Evaluate model performance per client and in aggregate.

---

## 🧪 Datasets Used

- **Breast Cancer**: Classification based on tumor features.
- **Cardiovascular Disease**: Prediction using clinical health indicators.
